# Week-4
Description of the Code for Week 4 Task
This script is designed to complete the Week 4 task for Data Science interns, focusing on advanced web scraping and data processing. Below is a detailed explanation of each part:

1. Library Installation
The script installs the necessary libraries (requests, selenium, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) and sets up Chromium WebDriver for Selenium in Google Colab.
Commands like !apt-get update and !apt install chromium-chromedriver ensure Selenium runs in Colab's environment.
2. Task 1: Web Scraping with API Integration
Objective: Extract data from public APIs to avoid traditional HTML parsing.
Steps:
Fetches data from the GitHub API using the requests library.
Converts the JSON response into a Pandas DataFrame for better handling.
Saves the structured data to a CSV file (github_repositories.csv).
Deliverables:
CSV file containing details of public GitHub repositories.
Preview of the extracted data using df.head().
3. Task 2: Handling Dynamic Content with Selenium
Objective: Scrape dynamically loaded content from JavaScript-rendered websites.
Steps:
Configures a headless Chrome WebDriver for use in Colab.
Navigates to a sample website (https://quotes.toscrape.com/scroll) with JavaScript-loaded content.
Extracts data (quotes and authors) by targeting elements dynamically with Selenium.
Stores the data in a JSON file (quotes.json).
Deliverables:
JSON file containing quotes and their respective authors.
Logs to confirm successful data extraction.
4. Task 3: Data Cleaning and Analysis
Objective: Process and clean the scraped data and analyze trends.
Steps:
Loads the previously scraped GitHub data (github_repositories.csv) using Pandas.
Cleans the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
Analyzes the top 5 programming languages used in GitHub repositories.
Visualizes the results with a bar chart using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Deliverables:
A cleaned dataset displayed using Pandas.
A bar chart showing the top 5 programming languages.
5. Task 4: Comparison of Tools and Techniques
Objective: Evaluate the performance, complexity, and suitability of BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium.
Steps:
Creates a comparison table in Pandas with the following factors:
Speed
Ease of use
Capability to handle dynamic content
Prints the table for quick reference.
Deliverables:
A comparison table summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of each tool.
Key Points
Versatility: The script demonstrates API-based scraping (efficient for structured data), Selenium for dynamic content, and Pandas for cleaning and analysis.
Dynamic Handling: Selenium is configured for Google Colab, enabling scraping of JavaScript-rendered pages.
Data Insights: The cleaning and visualization steps provide actionable insights from the scraped data.
Tool Comparison: Helps assess which tool is best suited for specific scraping tasks.
How to Use the Code
Run in Google Colab: Copy the script into a Colab notebook and execute each cell sequentially.
Inspect Deliverables:
Review the github_repositories.csv and quotes.json files.
View visualizations directly in the Colab notebook.
Analyze the comparison table to understand tool performance.
